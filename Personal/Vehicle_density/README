Input example: "1.2 10 0.4 1.5 0.9" 
! An arbitrary amount/ sort of characters can be put in between values,
! only the digits, periods and their order matter.
! So this is also possible: "1.2, 10; |0.4|1.5|0.9|"

Stands for:
- 1.2 = Position to calculate density for
- 10 = the amount of itterations (smoothing factor)
- 0.4 etc. = recorded (vehicle)positions

Output: density on point 1.2

Algorithm: Close-in
It will iteratively calculate the density over an ever shrinking area(of the trajectory),
with each iteration closing-in on the point you want to calculate.
When the iteration limit is reached all the results (density for each iteration)
will be compiled into one density.
