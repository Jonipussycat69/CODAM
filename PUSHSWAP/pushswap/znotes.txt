Fix:
	The original main segfaults in push_swap!

LEFTOFF:
	Calibrating -> test on different sortedness
	Implement callibration in init_multiplier
	TAKE A LOOK at if the DOUBLE actions are correctly checked and done!

To do?
	Change to const for safety
	Add headers
	Clean up and organize files
	Remove 'ok' and 'err' checks where there is no malloc!
	Rewrite MAKEFILE
